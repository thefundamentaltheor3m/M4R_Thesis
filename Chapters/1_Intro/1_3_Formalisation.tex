\section{The Formalisation Movement}

\begin{comment}

In a project description that was published after Hales's paper, he wrote, of his motivations,
\begin{quote}
    \textit{In response to the lingering doubt about the correctness of the proof, at the beginning of 2003, I launched the \emph{Flyspeck} project, whose aim is a complete formal verification of the Kepler Conjecture. In truth, my motivations for the project are far more complex than a simple hope of removing residual doubt from the minds of few referees. Indeed, I see formal methods as fundamental to the long-term growth of mathematics.} \cite{FlyspeckAnnouncement}
\end{quote}

NOTE TO SELF: Say something about the prophetic nature of the second half of his statement ("In truth..."). Use that to introduce the formalisation movement.
