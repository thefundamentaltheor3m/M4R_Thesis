On 5 July, 2022, in Helsinki, Finland, the International Mathematical Union announced the names of the four mathematicians who were to be awarded the Fields Medal, the most coveted prize in the world of mathematics: Hugo Duminil-Copin, June Huh, James Maynard and Maryna Viazovska. Duminil-Copin, Huh and Maynard received this most prestigious honour for making several outstanding contributions to their specific fields of expertise---respectively, statistical physics, geometric combinatorics, and analytic number theory. Viazovska, on the other hand, was awarded the Fields Medal for a more focused line of research: the pursuit if the great mysteries of $\R^8$ and $\R^{24}$, chief amongst them the optimality of the $E_8$ and Leech lattice sphere packings in these spaces. Her solution in dimension $8$ is particularly revolutionary: it uses insights from Fourier analysis and the theory of modular forms to construct a special function---the so-called Magic Function---that, in combination with a previous result by Cohn and Elkies, proves that the $E_8$ lattice packing is the densest possible sphere packing in $\R^8$. Very shortly afterwards, Cohn, Kumar, Miller, Radchenko and Viazovska were able to use similar ideas to prove that the Leech lattice packing is the densest possible sphere packing in $\R^{24}$.

Before Viazovska's remarkable breakthrough, the optimal sphere packing density was only known in dimensions $1$, $2$ and $3$ \cite{CohnOnViazovskaICM}. Furthermore, Thomas Hales' solution in dimension $3$ \cite{HalesKeplerInformal} was lengthy and involved extensive computer-assisted calculations; in contrast, Viazovska's proof in dimension $8$ is elegant and concise. Even before Viazovska was awarded the Fields Medal, her work received wide acclaim from eminent mathematicians across the world: Peter Sarnak described it as ``stunningly simple, as all great things are,'' and Akshay Venkatesh remarked that her Magic Function is very likely ``part of some richer story'' that connects to other areas of mathematics and physics \cite{QuantaPiece}. Viazovska's work is a truly remarkable achievement in modern mathematics, with its elegance coming from the manner in which the many pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly together. One of the goals of this project is to offer a detailed exposition of one of those pieces: the construction of the so-called `Magic Function' in dimension $8$.
