\chapter{Viazovska's Magic Function, Formally}
\label{Ch5:Chapter}
\thispagestyle{empty}
% I really don't like this chapter name because idt it reflects the essence of the chapter, which is "the key aspects of the formalisation/challenges faced and overcome". But that's not a good title either. Gotta find something in the middle!

In this chapter, we discuss aspects of the formalisation that we alluded to, but did not discuss in detail, in \Cref{Ch4:Chapter}.

Throughout \Cref{Ch4:Chapter}, particularly in \Cref{Ch4:Sec:Defs,Ch4:Sec:Schwartzness,Ch4:Sec:Double_Zeroes}, we provided incredibly detailed arguments. The purpose of doing this was to ensure a correspondence between the informal text in this document and the formal proof or proof path written or envisioned by the author. This approach was also intended to pre-empt challenges that would be faced when ultimately formalising Viazovska's proof.

We note that while the formalisation is still actively in progress, over the course of this M4R, the author has made significant progress towards formalising the contents of \Cref{Ch4:Chapter}. These steps are highlighted across this chapter. In \Cref{Ch5:Sec:Gen_Overview_of_Formalisation}, we give a broad overview of the author's contributions and account for the minor but deliberate and carefully considered differences between Viazovska's original proof in \cite{Viazovska8} and the author's exposition of it in \Cref{Ch4:Chapter}.  In \Cref{Ch5:Sec:Meta}, we briefly discuss an innovative approach conceived by Macbeth and the author to simplify computations in $\C$, which has since been implemented with significant contributions by Xie. In \Cref{Ch5:Sec:Cauchy-Goursat}, we discuss the nuances that make the \CGT, an integral part of Viazovska's proof, a challenging theorem to formalise, and outline how some, but not all, of these challenges have been overcome by the author over the course of this M4R.
