\chapter{Viazovska's Magic Function, Informally}
\label{Ch4:Chapter}

In this chapter, we will construct the $+1$-eigenfunction $a$, the $-1$-eigenfunction $b$, and the magic function $g$. The theory developed in \Cref{Ch3:Chapter} tells us what properties we would like all three functions to satisfy, and in \Cref{Ch3:Sec:Properties}, we summarised those properties concisely. Over the course of this chapter, we prove that they do, indeed, satisfy them. The content is based heavily on Viazovska's original paper \cite{Viazovska8} and a more detailed version of her proof that she wrote for the project blueprint \cite{blueprint}. Note that the current version of the blueprint may contain modifications that have been included to make it correspond more closely with the current state of the formalisation effort.

We begin by defining the functions in question. In each subsequent section of this chapter, we will prove a certain property for each of the eigenfunctions. Finally, in \Cref{Ch4:Sec:g_Properties}, we will prove that $g$ does, indeed, satisfy the properties outlined in \Cref{Ch3:Chapter}.
