\chapter{Viazovska's Magic Function, Informally}
\label{Ch4:Chapter}

In this chapter, we will construct the $+1$-eigenfunction $a$, the $-1$-eigenfunction $b$, and the magic function $g$. The theory developed in \Cref{Ch3:Chapter} tells us what properties we would like all three functions to satisfy, and in \Cref{Ch3:Sec:Properties}, we summarised those properties concisely. Over the course of this chapter, we prove that they do, indeed, satisfy them.

We begin by defining the functions in question. In each subsequent section of this chapter, we will prove a certain property for each of the eigenfunctions. Finally, in \Cref{Ch4:Sec:g_Properties}, we will prove that $g$ does, indeed, satisfy the properties outlined in \Cref{Ch3:Chapter}.
