\section{Another Representation of the Eigenfunctions}

We have already established numerous properties of $a$ and $b$: we have shown they are Schwartz, that they are indeed $\pm1$-eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, and that they have double zeroes at all points of $\Lambda_8$ that have norm $> \sqrt{2}$. Our ultimate objective, however, is to construct a magic function $g$ as a $\C$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$ that satisfies the Cohn-Elkies conditions \ref{CE1}-\ref{CE3}.
