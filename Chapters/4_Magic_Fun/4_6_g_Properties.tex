\section{The Magic of $g$}
\label{Ch4:Sec:g_Properties}

In this section, we briefly describe the construction of $g$ and discuss how one can show that $g$ satisfies \ref{CE1}-\ref{CE3} and solves the famed sphere packing problem in $8$ dimensions.

While our arguments in \Cref{Ch4:Sec:Schwartzness,Ch4:Sec:Eig,Ch4:Sec:Double_Zeroes} established that $a$ and $b$ satisfy the necessary conditions outlined in \Cref{Ch3:Sec:Properties}, it is neither clear what linear combination of them makes $g$, nor what
