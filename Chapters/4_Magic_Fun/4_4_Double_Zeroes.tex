\section{Establishing the Double Zeroes Property}

The way we prove that $a$ and $b$ have double zeroes at $E_8$ lattice points with norm $> \sqrt{2}$ (or at normalised $E_8$ lattice points with norm $> 1$) is by expressing the functions $a\rad$ and $b\rad$ as products of the $\sin^2$ function and another function, expressed as an integral.

The strategy to prove these two equalities will be to perform a change of contours using a version of the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem and use the relations and transformation rules between the $\phi$- and $\psi$-functions to combine integrals so that the result is exactly $a\rad$ or $b\rad$.
