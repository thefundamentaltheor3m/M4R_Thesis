Over the course of this thesis, we have explored a revolutionary approach to a classical problem that has since led to deep insights into the mysteries of the $E_8$ lattice, its $24$-dimensional counterpart, the Leech lattice, and the broader theory of radial Schwartz functions. Previously unexplored links to the theory of modular forms have since revealed deep symmetries that have led to fascinating results, such as Cohn, Kumar, Miller, Radchenko and Viazovska's universal optimality and Fourier interpolation formulas \cite{UniversalOptimality} that reconstruct radial Schwartz functions $f$ from the values and radial derivatives of $f$ and $\hat{f}$, generalising Viazovska's approach to solving the sphere packing problem in $\R^8$.

The advent of formalisation marks the beginning of an epistemological revolution that will solidify the certainty with which use and build on existing results. The formalisation of Viazovska's groundbreaking work could not come at a better time: we stand at the precipice of innumerable possibilities, informal and formal, and a complete, \sorry-free verification of Viazovksa's work would be a vote of confidence that both fields are progressing in the right direction.

In the sections below, we summarise the author's key takeaways at the end of this project.
