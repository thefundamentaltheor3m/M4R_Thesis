Over the course of this thesis, we have explored a revolutionary approach to a classical problem that has since led to deeper insights into the mysteries of the $E_8$ lattice, its $24$-dimensional counterpart, the Leech lattice, and the broader theory of radial Schwartz functions. Previously unexplored links to the theory of modular forms are revealing deep symmetries that lead to fascinating results, such as Cohn, Kumar, Miller, Radchenko and Viazovska's universal optimality and Fourier interpolation formulas \cite{UniversalOptimality} that reconstruct radial Schwartz functions $f$ from the values and radial derivatives of $f$ and $\hat{f}$, generalising Viazovska's approach to solving the sphere packing problem in $\R^8$.
