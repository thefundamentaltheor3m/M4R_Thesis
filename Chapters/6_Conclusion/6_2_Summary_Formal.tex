\section{The Road to Formalising Sphere Packing}

It has been a little over a year since Viazovska's announcement that a collaboration was underway to formalise her work. While there has been progress, the road to formalising sphere packing has not been as smooth as Viazovska's Fourier eigenfunctions. Numerous challenges have arisen, from the sheer complexity of the computations (eg. the formalisation of \Cref{SP:PolyFourierCoeffBound}) to the subtleties in Viazovska's arguments (eg. the inapplicability of the na√Øve construction of $d$-dimensional Schwartz functions from $1$-dimensional Schwartz functions by composition with the norm squared). That being said, despite still being fairly far from complete, this formalisation effort has all the makings of a paradigm-shifter, both for the formalisation community and the mathematics community at large. Every success inspires greater confidence that an eventual formalisation, if slow, is achievable.
