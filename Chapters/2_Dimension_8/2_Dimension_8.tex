\chapter{The Ingredients of Viazovska's Solution}
\thispagestyle{empty}
% It might be worth chucking a large part of this chapter into an appendix. Specifically, ยง2.1.1 (Sphere Packing Fundamentals) and ยง2.3 (Modular Forms). Need to think about this... this would also depend on how we phrase ยง1.3 (scope of project) because we need to make it EXTREMELY CLEAR that the purpose of this project was NOT to delve deep into a cool application of the theory of modular forms but rather to learn how to formalise modern, computationally involved mathematics.

The purpose of this chapter is to offer background information that will be essential to understanding the rest of this exposition. We will begin by providing precise mathematical definitions for sphere packings, densities, and the sphere packing constant. We will then discuss the variation of the linear programming bound proven by Cohn and Elkies \cite[Theorem 3.1]{CohnElkies} used by Viazovska \cite[Theorem 2]{Viazovska8}. Finally, we will include a small discussion on the theory of modular forms and establish its relevance to the subsequent chapters of this thesis, which will focus on the construction of the Magic Function.

We will be minimalistic in our discussions, and primarily focus on motivating new concepts and their relevance to the sphere packing problem in dimension $8$. This section is not intended to offer an exhaustive treatment of the mathematics we will encounter, which is as vast as it is rich.
