\chapter{The Sphere Packing Problem in Dimension $8$}
\thispagestyle{empty}
% It might be worth chucking a large part of this chapter into an appendix. Specifically, ยง2.1.1 (Sphere Packing Fundamentals) and ยง2.3 (Modular Forms). Need to think about this... this would also depend on how we phrase ยง1.3 (scope of project) because we need to make it EXTREMELY CLEAR that the purpose of this project was NOT to delve deep into a cool application of the theory of modular forms but rather to learn how to formalise modern, computationally involved mathematics.

The purpose of this chapter is to conduct a detailed examination of Viazovska's original paper solving the sphere packing problem in dimension $8$ \cite{Viazovska8} and the formalisation blueprint \cite{blueprint}. While we have already seen the high-level idea in \Cref{Ch1:Sec:1_1_Sphere_Packing}, in this chapter, we will take a closer look at the mathematical details.

We will begin by providing precise mathematical definitions for sphere packings, densities, and the sphere packing constant. We will then discuss the linear programming bound conceived by Cohn and Elkies \cite[Theorem 3.1]{CohnElkies} (or, more precisely, the slight modification thereof that is more directly applicable: see \cite[Theorem 2]{Viazovska8} and \cite[Theorem 5.1]{blueprint}). Finally, we will include a small discussion on the theory of modular forms and establish its relevance to the subsequent chapters of this thesis, which will focus on the construction of the `Magic Function' (denoted as $g$ in \cite[Theorem 3]{Viazovska8}).

In each section, we will not only mathematical details from the sources outlined above but also an overview of the choices made and challenges encountered when formalising these notions. While this chapter primarily concerns the contents of the first three sections of \cite{Viazovska8}, which are not within the scope of this project, there is an undeniable relevance of both the informal and the formal definitions and results. It is therefore necessary to include a detailed treatment thereof before we can construct $g$ and prove it satisfies the desired `Magic' properties.
