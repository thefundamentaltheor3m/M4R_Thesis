\section{A Word on Modular Forms}
\label{Ch2:Sec:ModForms}

\begin{comment}
Things to discuss:
1. What is a modular form
2. What is a quasimodular form
3. Examples: Eisenstein Series, Jacobi Theta functions, Discriminant form
We can reference things like the q-expansions of the Eisenstein series, the transformation rules for the Jacobi theta functions, and the product formula for the discriminant form.
