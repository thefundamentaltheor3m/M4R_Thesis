\chapter{The $+1$-Eigenfunction}

In this chapter, we will construct the $+1$-eigenfunction $a$ of the magic function. The theory developed in \Cref{Ch3:Chapter} tells us what properties we would like it to satisfy, and over the course of this chapter, we prove that it does, indeed, satisfy those properties.
