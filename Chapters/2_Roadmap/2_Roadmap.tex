\chapter{A Roadmap to Constructing the Magic Function}
\thispagestyle{empty}

We mentioned, in the introduction, that the scope of this project is to construct Viazovska's Magic Function in Lean and prove that it satisfies certain specific properties, such as satisfying the hypotheses of the \CELP. In this chapter, we will outline the steps we will take to achieve this goal. In particular, we will list all the conditions we need to prove that the Magic Function satisfies. Our approach will be to construct the Magic Function in terms of two intermediary functions. Proving it satisfies the necessary conditions will then be a matter of proving that these intermediary functions satisfy certain properties. We will list these properties as well.
