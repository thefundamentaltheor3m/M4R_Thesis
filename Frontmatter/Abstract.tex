    In 2022, Maryna Viazovska was awarded the Fields Medal for an outstanding achievement: solving the sphere packing problem in dimension $8$. The ingenuity of Viazovska's solution stems from her combination of techniques from the apparently unrelated theories of radial Schwartz functions and modular forms. Her proof involves constructing the so-called Magic Function, which, in this report, we will understand to be worthy of its name.

    In addition to offering an exposition of Viazovska's work, we describe important progress made in the ongoing attempt to formalise Viazovska's remarkable solution in the Lean Theorem Prover. This is a large-scale, ongoing endeavour, and we highlight the author's involvement and contributions to the effort.
