# Viazovska's Magic Function in Dimension 8: An Attempt at Formalisation

Welcome to my MSci thesis, written under the supervision of Bhavik Mehta over the 2024-2025 academic year at Imperial College London. The project this thesis is about has evolved into a large-scale, open-source collaboration. For more information, visit the project [website](https://thefundamentaltheor3m.github.io/Sphere-Packing-Lean) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/Sphere-Packing-Lean).

While I submitted my thesis in June, my work has current value because it relates to an ongoing project. It may hence be updated from time to time. Click [here](https://thefundamentaltheor3m.github.io/M4R_Thesis/main.pdf) to read a current version of the document. Enjoy!
